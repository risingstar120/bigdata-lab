## Python Introduction
(Python CheatSheet)[]
### Required
- Python 3.5

### Motivations for Python
- Python is very popular in science and engineering: check [SciPy](https://scipy.org), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org).
- Python is free software (as in freedom)
- Python is portable, available for all major operating systems
- Python is a versatile language, "the second best language for everything"
- Python has a lively online community, active on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and many other forums

### Other notes

- Python is an interpreted language
- [Google](google.com) and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) are your best friends!

### Hello World
```
print("Hello world")
```
### Variables
Python is dynamically typed.
In this first example, `otter` is set as an integer and its value equal 3.
```
otter = 3
```
Right after assigning 3 to `otter` you can change your mind and assign a string ...
```
otter = "Otters will rule the world."
otter = 'Otters will rule the world.'
```
... or a list.
```
otter = ["Otters", "will", "rule", "Mars", "in", "2037"]
otter = [67, 51, 17, 101, 48]
```
